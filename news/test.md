Charaterized by dark thematic overtones juxtaposed with distinctly electronic vocals - SOOOO joins the Featured Artist lineup with song selections from their latest EP XXXXX!

[![](LINK NEEDED)

First popularized on osu! and Youtube following the success of their track Happppy song, SOOOO is a standout among vocaloid artists for their subversion of typical poppy vocaloid styles replacing them with an intense, sinister sound.



Here's a sample of what we've got in store for you to map to:

### Acid Rain

*This track was featured as the pick for Aspire 2018.*

### Relucent (featuring ZES)

*A special bonus track at the end of the digital edition of Deliverance, Relucent is a celebration of all the acoustic-electronic fusion displayed throughout the album.*

### Impulse (featuring Au5)

*From the second part of the Unity Project album collection, Impulse is perhaps one of the most iconic osu! tracks in recent years, thanks to [handsome's award winning map](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/705788#osu/1492654).*

### Pencilina (featuring Dictate)

*A collaborative piece between Culprate and Dictate, this track merges their two distinct sounds to produce something very, very special.*

### Aurora (featuring Bloom)

*Rocking in on the third part of the Unity Project albums is a profoundly funky twist on Culprate's classic sound. You may be familiar with this one from the recent OWC 2018 streams.*

### Mechanic Heartbeat (featuring Keota & Sophie Meiers)

*Otherworldly vocals set amid resonating synths and a memorable two-tap beat pose a unique challenge for mappers to tackle in perhaps one of the most difficult song picks we've selected for the Featured Artist project.*

Check out all these and more, over at [**Culprate**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/29). If you like what you hear, there's a plethora of links on his listing to all of his social media outlets.

As always, all Featured Artists tracks come pre-timed and are 100% licensed for use in osu! — so worry less, and map more!

We're excited to see how people take and build upon his incredible sound, and we're also stoked to see what the entrants of Aspire 2018 have produced with *Acid Rain* sometime during this coming December.

Keep your eyes and ears peeled, December's going to be a hell of a month for the Featured Artist project!
